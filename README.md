# Notes:

- Detecting dangerous illnesses connected to the skin organ, particularly malignancy, requires the identification of pigmented skin lesions. 
- Image detection techniques and computer classification capabilities can boost skin cancer detection accuracy. 
- The dataset used for this research work is based on the HAM10000 dataset which consists of 10015 images. The proposed work has chosen a subset of the dataset and performed augmentation.
- Involving data augmentation can improve the accuracy of the model. But that model cannot give significant results with the testing data until it is robust. 
- We have analyzed the classification accuracy of the Machine Learning algorithms and Convolutional Neural Network and CNN architechture MobileNet. 
- The proposed work helps early identification of seven classes of skin disease and can be validated and treated appropriately by medical practitioners.
